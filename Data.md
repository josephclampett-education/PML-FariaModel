Recalculating specific Faraday threshold (0.004950_0.000100_2.376330) using higher-res (256x256) grid

Redoing the same threshold (0.004950_0.000100_2.376330) but with 10 gaussians instead of the above which used a Bessel. We find the threshold is lower, 5.60 vs 5.74.

We looked at 2025-08-04/17 when we swept h1 and radius for a fixed phase 1.2 (which TODO we now know is too low). There was only one h1 >= 0.2 mm run that blew up - the cavity mode one (R = 2.63) - so we will pick that one and sweep droplet number.
